* Make your changes in your local `Project_1_TTT` repo.
* Use either HTML or, even better, [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format this file as you document your project.
* `git add` and `git commit` your changes as you go.  Remember to say what you did in your commit messages!

### Process (in order)
1. Design the Mockup
  I designed a visual mockup of the possible  *_States_* of Tic-Tac-Toe in wireframe mode. Wireframe mode helped to me to focus on state,
  postponing the majority of the style decisions until after the logic is finalized and a statically html mockup completed. The States I determined were as follows:
  * Who Starts? ![Who Starts?]:
  After refreshing browser, the player scores are set to 0, and the board is cleared.  The panel will prompt either player to make the first move.
  The first player to select an Avatar(_X_ or _O_ ) makes the first move.  This player continues to be X or O for as many games played until  
  the browser is refreshed.  Player scores (located below the Avatars) are updated after each game.
  * Go! ![Go]:
  This Figure shows X has decided to go first.  Subsequently, O's avatar is dimmed in order to reinforce that it is X's move.
  * Contemplate Move ![Contemplate Move]:
  As X hovers over the board, contemplating their move, a semi-transparent X is displayed.  A gear icon spins to reinforce the _move contemplation_ state.
  * Make Move ![Make Move]:
  
  * I win ![I Win]:

2. Set up the directory templates
